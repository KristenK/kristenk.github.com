<h4>Audience</h4>
    <p>The call to reform art came early in the 20th cenutry, and central to issues of reform was the audience. America had experienced a previous “mural renaissance” during the late 19th century, producing works with complex allegorical programs steeped in a European tradition. By the 1920s these murals were being to be seen as antiquated and out of touch with the everyday American. American journals such <em>The New Masses</em>, and <em>The Liberator</em> where some of the first to begin calling for a reform in American art. Men such as theorist Lewis Mumford and artist Hugo Gellert were just some of the vocal critics of the decadence and exclusivity of late 19th and early 20th century American art. They championed a new genre of art they name "Proletarian Art" art for the average man... </p>

    <p>Virginia Marquardt sums up the basic tenets of proletarian art as “the self-deprecating demeanor of the unschooled critics; the unsophisticated worker viewed as a genuine appreciator of art; and the elevation of direct, forthright character as the fundamental criterion of art.”# Also present in the discourse of proletarian art is a strong anti-bourgeois sentiment and the introduction of the artist as propagandist. Proletarian art was made for the people and had to be accesible to the people. Public art, like murals and widely circulated prints, became the most celebreated form of proletarian art. </p>

    <p>Proletarian art is heavily influenced by Leninist-Marxism. Lenin equated the artist to a cog in the great machine of society, and only when his art reflected society could it be true art.</p>
    <blockquote>Art belongs to the people. It must let its roots go down deep into the very thick of the laboring masses. It should be understood and loved by these masses. It must unite and elevate their feelings, thoughts and will. It must awaken and develop the artistic instinct within them. Must we serve sweet cakes to a small minority while the workers and the peasants are in need of black bread?<cite>Vladimir Lenin, Marxism and Art</cite></blockquote>
    <p>While American theorists were debating whom art should cater to, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera were also debating what art should be and whom it should serve. In 1919, Siqueiros received a government grant to study art in Europe in recognition of his good military service during the Mexican revolution. In Paris he met Rivera, who at the time was heavily involved with the avant-garde cubists. </p>
    <div id="galery"><img src="http://i1311.photobucket.com/albums/s662/kkorfitz/riveraclock_zpsbac5ef05.jpg"<img src="http://i1311.photobucket.com/albums/s662/kkorfitz/riverazapata_zps227b45ec.jpg"</div>
    <p>Siqueiros found the formal experimentation of the European avant-garde lacking in substance. He criticized the artists for being too concerned with “aesthetic trivialities,” and could not find a “common philosophical or political ground with the French avant-garde.”(Philip stein 32)</p>
    <div id="gallery"><img src="http://i1311.photobucket.com/albums/s662/kkorfitz/SchoolOfAthens_zps72baf027.jpg"><img src="http://i1311.photobucket.com/albums/s662/kkorfitz/Michelangelo1_zpsb8a3789b.jpg"></div>
    <p>Siqueiros and Rivera made their way to Italy where they were particularly taken with the murals of the Italian Renaissance. The public nature of the murals and their function of educating through imagery fulfilled the need for the humanity that Siqueiros felt was missing in the work of the French avant-garde. It was also in Europe where Siqueiros was introduced to Leninist-Marxist ideology, which would serve as the main influence of his overall artistic philosophy. Under the influence of Lenin and the Italian masters, Siqueiros and Rivera theorized that the mural could be the great modern art form. </p>

    <h4 class="clear">Style</h4>
	   <p>In 1921, Siqueiros published Three Appeals for the Current Guidance of the New Generation of American Painters and Sculptors in which he applies Leninist-Marxist theory to modern art in America. In the manifesto, he calls for art to “restore the lost values of painting and sculpture as well as endowing art with new values.”# A return to lost values was a direct critique of modernist abstraction which had become overly occupied with formal experimentation.</p>

<p>Siqueiros manafesto was exteremly influence for both Mexican and American artists. In the manifeto Siqueiros encourages artists to ignore European influence and look to their own national traditions. Avant-garde "isms" were symptamatic of European decadence, to restore "the lost values of painting and sculpture" Siqueiros urges artists to adopt a more traditionally formalist style while displaying the spirit of the age. What results is a monumental style, filled with solid forms, dynamic angles and colors, clean lines, and the spirit of the "dynamic" age.
