<h4>American Journals</h4>
<p class="clear">The call to reform art came early in the 20th cenutry, and central to issues of reform was the audience. America had experienced a previous “mural renaissance” during the late 19th century, producing works with complex allegorical programs steeped in a European tradition. By the 1920s these murals were being to be seen as antiquated and out of touch with the everyday American. American journals such <em>The New Masses</em>, and <em>The Liberator</em> where some of the first to begin calling for a reform in American art. Men such as theorist Lewis Mumford and artist Hugo Gellert were just some of the vocal critics of the decadence and exclusivity of late 19th and early 20th century American art.

El Machete successfully connected imagery with political rhetoric, but most importantly the journal made that connection visible in an effective way. The murals at the National Preparatory School lacked the ability to communicate the ideas of the Syndicate to those who would be most receptive to them. The literal ability of El Machete to circulate made it infinitely more successful at disseminating content than the stationary murals.</p>
