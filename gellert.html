<h1>Hugo Gellert</h1>
<h3>(1892 – 1985)</h3>
<p>Hugo Gellert was born May 3, 1892 in Budapest, Hungary. In 1906, the family emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City, where they put down roots.
Gellert studied at the Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design.
His wife was named Livia. Gellert, a committed socialist who later joined the Communist Party of America considered his politics inseparable from his art. He had said that "Being an artist and being a communist are one and the same." He used his art to advance his ideals for the common people, and much of his art depicted what he saw as the injustices of racial divides and capitalism. Often his works were captured with slogans that helped further the illustration. The Working Day, for example shows a black laborer standing back to back with a white miner, and is accompanied by a phrase from Karl Marx’s Das Kapital, "Labor with a white skin cannot emancipate itself where labor with a black skin is branded. "</p>
<p>Opposed to World War I, Gellert published his first anti-war art in 1916. His work was prominently featured both in the illustrated magazine of the Hungarian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America, Előre (Forward) as well as Max Eastman's radical monthly magazine The Masses from this time.[4] He also created numerous illustrations for Eastman's successor magazine, The Liberator, as well as sundry publications of the Communist Party USA after its formation, such as The Workers Monthly and The New Masses. Later, he was offered a position as a staff artist for The New Yorker magazine. In 1925, he moved to the New York Times.
In 1927, Gellert was appointed the leader of the Anti-Horthy League, the first American anti-fascist organization. In this capacity, he organized a demonstration against U.S. president Calvin Coolidge, and both he and his wife were arrested while picketing the White House.
In 1932, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, feeling uncomfortable about Gellert’s public persona and politics, petitioned to have Gellert’s work removed from its collection. However, they were forced to reconsider when other artists, many of whom did not share Gellert’s social idealism, came to his defense as fellow artists and threatened to withdraw their own works.
In 1939, Gellert helped organize the group, “Artists for Defense” and he later became the Chairman for “Artists for Victory”, an organization that included over 10,000 members.<p>
