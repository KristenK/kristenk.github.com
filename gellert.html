<h1>Hugo Gellert</h1>
<h3>(1892 – 1985)</h3>
<p>Hugo Gellert was born May 3, 1892 in Budapest Hungary. He emigrated to the United States with his family in 1906 and settled in New York City. In New York Gellert pursued art at the Cooper Union and later the National Academy of Design. A lifelong socialist, Gellert was deeply committed to politics and eventually joined the Communist Party of America. He considered his art inseparable from his political convictions and became an active member of activist-art groups like the Artist's Committee for Action and the Artists' Union.<sup><a href="#100" id="fn1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Gellert may be best known for his political drawings, including numerous illustrated covers for The Liberator and New Masses.  Gellert was heavily influenced by Soviet art, making his first of many trips to Russia in 1927.  In 1928 Gellert was commissioned to paint a mural for the Workers Party Cafeteria on Union Square in New York. The commission featured a large freeze with laborer figures surrounded by industrial architecture and an over life size portrait of Vladimir Lenin. The mural recieved rave reviews. The New Yorker wrote:<p>
<blockquote>The Gellert murals are the only ones on this contient except those of Rivera in Mexico City that are really contemporary. We have been shameful in our failure to use artists in our buildings, and the Prolectos [sic] cafeteria may start something... The labor party is fortunate in having a spokesman as articulate as this artist.<cite>New Yorker (10 November 1928):105</cite></blockquote>
<p>The Workers Party Cafeteria commission marked Gellert as one of the foremost modern muralists in America. When the Museum of Modern Art announced its plans to put on Murals by American Painters and Photographers, Gellert was contacted to submit. His panel <em>Us Guys Gotta Stick Together</em> and accompanying mural sketches caused controversy for their unflattering depictions of MoMA board members and powerful American business figures. His work, along with William Gropper and Ben Shahn’s submissions were threatened to be removed from the exhibition but eventually were allowed to remain in the show. Gellert published the essay <em>We Captuer the Walls</em> in response to the exhibition.</p>
<p>Gellert was posthumously, the subject of a more recent mural controversy when his murals for the <a href="http://newdeal.feri.org/gellert/index.htm">Seward Park Housing Corporation</a> in Lower East Side, Manhattan where up for demolition in 2003. Once a low income housing project, the newly privatized Seward Park Housing Corporation felt the socialist murals were no longer representative of the building. A public write in campaign has delayed their removal but they still remain threatened. </p>
