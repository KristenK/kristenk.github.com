<h1>Museum of Modern Art</h1>
<h3>Muralism gets institutional approval</h3>

<p>The Museum of Modern Art held two mural exhibitions in the early 1930s that helped develop the aesthetic style of the American Mural movement. These were the 1931 retrospective of works by Diego Rivera, and the 1932 Murals by American Painters and Photographers. </p>

    <p id class="clear">By 1931 Diego Rivera was well known and revered throughout Mexico and the United States. In 1927 he had had his first American solo exhibition at the Weyhe Gallery in New York, and in 1930 had started work on his mural series for the San Francisco Stock exchange. In an op-ed piece published in 1931 Alfred H. Barr Jr., friend of Rivera and first director of the Museum of Modern Art stated that Rivera’s Mexican frescos were among the most important works of art of the 20th century.<sup><a href="#100" id="fn1">1</a></sup>
 </p>
     <p>While working on his mural series for the National Palace in Mexico City, Rivera was approached by art dealer Frances Flynn Paine about the possibility of launching a solo retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art. 
</p>
    <blockquote id class="quote">“To every modern artist, this is the pinnacle of professional success. As soon as I had completed the work presently required in the National Palace, I began to prepare for this show.”
<cite>Diego Rivera, My Art, My Life: An Autobiography (with Gladys March</cite></blockquote>
    <p>The exhibition included over 149 works by Rivera, including eight "portable fresco", large frescos painted on standalone slabs of concrete. The exhibtion received rave reviews. Rivera’s work brought to the American mainstream a new modern art. Art grounded in political ideology and traditional technique, but unique in subject and style. The lack of European influence, and the focus on the “authentic” Mexican experience was praised by critics. Art critic Edward Allen Jewel exclaimed that Rivera had found Mexico, and in doing so had found himself. <sup><a href="#102" id="fn12">2</a></sup>The New York Times reported that this was an exhibition not to be missed. </p>
    <p>From critical reviews we can surmise that subject matter, rather than medium or style made the largest impression among American artists and critics. (Infact Jewell defended the exhibition format to a New York Times reader who asserted that to really judge Rivera’s frescos, you had to view them in person rather than the made for museum version). Rivera himself claimed that he could see American artists trying to break free of European tradition and that they should look towards Indian art for inspiration.</p>
    <blockquote>The Indian art is the classical art of this country ... It is the true basis of American Tradition<cite>Diego Rivera, Rivera is Painting Museum Frescos, New York Times Dec 1931</cite></blockquote>
    <p>In early January Rivera and the Museum of Modern Art released the final three portable frescos which reignited press interest. The Museum of Modern art website notes that this renewed interest in the Rivera exhibition also sparked interest as to the artist political affiliations. Right wing critics began to denounce Rivera’s work as propaganda. While left wing critics criticised his affiliations with American capitalists. It is here that the mural discourse begins to split, where aesthetic and political concerns come into conflict. How much should art preach to its audience as opposed to letting the audience project onto the art? What’s right thematically for Mexico may not be right for America. What should the motivation to create art be? Can revolutionary art of the people be funded by big business? The failure of Murals by American Painters and Photographers would bring this debate to a head.</p>

<p id class="clear">In 1921, Siqueiros published <em>Three Appeals for the Current Guidance of the New Generation of American Painters and Sculptors</em> in which he applies Leninist-Marxist theory to modern art in America. In the manifesto, he calls for art to “restore the lost values of painting and sculpture as well as endowing art with new values.”# A return to lost values was a direct critique of modernist abstraction which had become overly occupied with formal experimentation.</p>
<p>Siqueiros's manifesto was extremely influence for both Mexican and American artists. In the manifesto Siqueiros encourages artists to ignore European influence and look to their own national traditions. Avant-garde "isms" were symptomatic of European decadence, to restore "the lost values of painting and sculpture" Siqueiros urges artists to adopt a more traditionally formalist style while displaying the spirit of the age. What results is a monumental style, filled with solid forms, dynamic angles and colors, clean lines, and the spirit of the "dynamic" age.
