<h1>Museum of Modern Art</h1>
<h3>Muralism gets institutional approval</h3>

<p>The Museum of Modern Art held two mural exhibitions in the early 1930s that helped develop the aesthetic style of the American Mural movement. These were the 1931 retrospective of works by Diego Rivera, and the 1932 Murals by American Painters and Photographers. </p>

    <p id class="clear">By 1931 Diego Rivera was well known and revered throughout Mexico and the United States. In 1927 he had had his first American solo exhibition at the Weyhe Gallery in New York, and in 1930 had started work on his mural series for the San Francisco Stock exchange. In an op-ed piece published in 1931 Alfred H. Barr Jr., friend of Rivera and first director of the Museum of Modern Art stated that Rivera’s Mexican frescos were among the most important works of art of the 20th century.<sup><a href="#100" id="fn1">1</a></sup>
 </p>
     <p>While working on his mural series for the National Palace in Mexico City, Rivera was approached by art dealer Frances Flynn Paine about the possibility of launching a solo retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art. 
</p>
    <blockquote id class="quote">“To every modern artist, this is the pinnacle of professional success. As soon as I had completed the work presently required in the National Palace, I began to prepare for this show.”
<cite>Diego Rivera, My Art, My Life: An Autobiography (with Gladys March</cite></blockquote>
    <p>The exhibition included over 149 works by Rivera, including eight "portable fresco", large frescos painted on standalone slabs of concrete. The exhibtion received rave reviews. Rivera’s work brought to the American mainstream a new modern art. Art grounded in political ideology and traditional technique, but unique in subject and style. The lack of European influence, and the focus on the “authentic” Mexican experience was praised by critics. Art critic Edward Allen Jewel exclaimed that Rivera had found Mexico, and in doing so had found himself. <sup><a href="#102" id="fn12">2</a></sup>The New York Times reported that this was an exhibition not to be missed. </p>
    <p>From critical reviews we can surmise that subject matter, rather than medium or style made the largest impression among American artists and critics. (Infact Jewell defended the exhibition format to a New York Times reader who asserted that to really judge Rivera’s frescos, you had to view them in person rather than the made for museum version). Rivera himself claimed that he could see American artists trying to break free of European tradition and that they should look towards Indian art for inspiration.</p>
    <blockquote>The Indian art is the classical art of this country ... It is the true basis of American Tradition<cite>Diego Rivera, Rivera is Painting Museum Frescos, New York Times Dec 1931</cite></blockquote>
    <p>In early January Rivera and the Museum of Modern Art released the final three portable frescos which reignited press interest. The Museum of Modern art website notes that this renewed interest in the Rivera exhibition also sparked interest as to the artist political affiliations. Right wing critics began to denounce Rivera’s work as propaganda. While left wing critics criticised his affiliations with American capitalists. It is here that the mural discourse begins to split, where aesthetic and political concerns come into conflict. How much should art preach to its audience as opposed to letting the audience project onto the art? What’s right thematically for Mexico may not be right for America. What should the motivation to create art be? Can revolutionary art of the people be funded by big business? The failure of Murals by American Painters and Photographers would bring this debate to a head.</p>

<p id class="clear">Rivera was one of many artists commissioned to paint a mural in the newly constructed Rockefeller Center. The skyscraper had long been fetched in modern art as the ultimate symbol of modernity and the building was already being hailed as a massive achievement in modern architecture. The decision to contract mural painters to execute its internal decorations added to its aura as a symbol of America’s modernity<sup><a href="#103" id="fn2">1</a></sup>. While Rivera was acknowledged to be one of the foremost mural painters in the world, a minor scandal over the importance his and other foreign artists commissions were given over American artists erupted. Some artistic circles protested that the Rockefeller Center murals should be an opportunity for American artists to launch their new mural Renaissance.</p>
<p>When the mural commissions for Rockefeller center were announced, it was reported that the majority of the mural decoration would go to American artists and be decided by competition. But when the actual commissions were annouced, the three largest and most prestigious went to forgein born artists, Rivera included. When it was further revealed that this decision had not been made by jury, both mainstream and left-wing artists and critics were outraged<sup><a href="#104" id="fn3">2</a></sup>. Closed mural commissions threatened to place the mural in the same elite sphere as traditional easel painting, which celebrated the few instead of the many. This threat to the democratic mural was alarming, but the lack of competition was made even more poignant due to the early years of the depression.</p>
<blockquote id class="quote">During these years of joblessness, Rockefeller Center with its huge wall spaces loomed big, as a mural decoration possibility for many an artist. They waited the completion of the buildings with impatient expectancy. Then came the news: these walls had been assigned without competition.<cite>Hugo Gellert, We Capture the Walls</cite></blockquote>
<p>In reference to the criticism over the Rockefeller Center project, the Museum of Modern Art announced a planned exhibition of American murals with the entries to the exhibition receiving top consideration for commissions in the completed building. The exhibition would not only provide the artists with the opportunity to compete for jobs, but also help establish America as a major player in this new thoroughly modern movement. A statement released by Lincoln Kirstein read “we feel that mural painting in America has suffered from a lack of opportunity to assert itself … hitherto, mural decoration had been … in the hands of Academic painters. This show will attempt to give younger painters a chance to show their work before a large audience.”<sup><a href="#105" id="fn4">3</a></sup> Artists like Georgia O’Keefe who had no interest in using the mural to make a political statement, were anxious to assert their technical skill and ingenuity. The theme of the exhibition was “post-war” and the exhibition would also introduce the photographic mural, a first for the North American movement.</p>

 <p id class="clear">Three panels submitted to the exhibition immediately proved problematic; Hugo Gellert’s Us Fellas Gotta Stick Together; William Gropper’s The Writing on the Wall; and Ben Shahn’s The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti. Stylistically and thematically, these works adhere most closely to the examples set forth by the Mexican movement, and consequently they were also the most controversial. All three artists had included demeaning caricatures of noted capitalists and anti-communist figures and expressed very obvious marxist sympathies. The recent controversies over communist imagery and obvious critique of financially and politically powerful people, sparked a debate within the museum as to whether the three works should be hung in the exhibition at all.</p>
 <p>The threat of negative public reaction was at the heart of the debate. Alfred A. Barr expressed his fear that in showing the works, the museum would be aligning themselves with a communist agenda and he was unwilling to jeopardize the image the museum had built by supporting a proven controversial subject. But more troubling was the outright critique of individuals who essentially controlled the museum’s future. Gellert and Gropper chose as their objects of ridicule J.P. Morgan whose close relationship with the Rockefellers, including Abby Aldrich Rockefeller who was on the MoMA board of trustees, made other board memembers uneasy with the work. Barr was more worried about offending the museum’s financial backers that he eventually offered a compromise to Gellert, suggesting that he instead submit a panel featuring a portrait of Lenin, which would convey the artist's political ideology without offending so many important people.</p>
 <p>David Wechsler suggests that, at least in Gellerts case, the controversial mural panels were submitted with the intent to cause outrage. When told that his work was to be removed, Gropper remarked that he expected such an outcome. Gellert’s refusal to substitute a image of Lenin for his capitalist cartoon figures suggests that simply proclaiming his political affiliation was not the point of the work. Wechsler argues that the artists were in fact reacting to the Mexican muralists, specifically Rivera, and their recent commissions for wealthy patrons who had previously been their object of ridicule. Rivera’s stock exchange murals were heavily criticised by the left-wing for completely abandoning the original ideals of the Mexican Muralists. His outright celebration of capitalism was seen as an effort to assuage the patron rather than speak to the people. Referring to the manifesto of Union of Mexican Workers, Technicians, Painters, and Sculptors, and its calls to actively destroy all forms of “bourgeois art” (which we can interpret as safe, inoffensive and aesthetically concerned art), and the Liberators early call for artists as propagandists, the works by Gropper, Gellert and Shahn are a return to the original values of proletarian art making based on a Mexican Model. The three panels bring to the forefront a decidedly uncomfortable issue, the exploitation of average American’s by big capitalism during a time of unprecedented economic crisis.</p>
