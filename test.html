<h3>1. Does the following need a citation?</h3>
<blockquote>During the Mexican Revolution, David Alfaro Siqueiros left the Art Academy of San Carlos to fight under General Carranza, who became Mexico’s constitutional president in 1917. As a reward for loyal service, Siqueiros, in 1919, received a fellowship to travel to Europe to further his artistic training.</blockquote>

<h3>2. Which example is correctly paraphrased?</h3>
<h4>Original Content</h4>
<blockquote>There can be no doubt that MacMonnies and Cassatt knew and admired Puvis’s work. But after looking closely at his work and that of other male and female Puvian muralists at the fair, it is clear that, while men accepted Puvis’s definition of utopia, women did not.<cite>Wanda M. Corn, Gender, American Art , Vol. 23, No. 1 (Spring 2009), pp. 25-26

<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>It’s obvious that MacMonnies and Cassatt were familiar with and admired Puvis’s paintings. Though after looking closely at his work and the work of other mural painters influenced by Puvis, it is clear that male artists accepted Puvis’s version of utopia, while women did not. </p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Wanda Corn notes that MacMonnies and Cassatt “knew and admired Puvis’s work” (Corn, 25). But Corn also mentions that after comparing the work of male and female followers of Puvis, that the murals painted by male artists more closely followed utopian vision, whereas the female artists did not.</p>
