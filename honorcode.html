<h2>The Honor Code</h2>
<h3>What you need to know</h3>

<P>As a member of the Mason community, it's your responsibility to be aware of and adhere to the University’s Honor Code. </p>
<p>The Honor Code is a “pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, and/or lie in matters related to academic work.” A violation of the honor code is a serious issue, regardless of intent. “I didn’t know” isn’t an excuse.</p>
 <p> You may think you know what a violation of the honor code is, but you may not be fully informed. Below are some common scenarios you might have found yourself confronted with or even committed unknowingly. Did you know you can self-plagiarize? You can review the Mason Honor Code in full at the <a href ="http://oai.gmu.edu/honor-code/masons-honor-code/">Office of Academic Integrity</a>.</P>
 <h2>Did you know?</h2>
<h4>Did you know that you plagiarized when you used a previous paper/computer program you created in another class in a new course?</h4>
<p>You must obtain permission of the professor before you use work from previous courses (this includes high school work). This is called self-plagiarism. </p>
<h4>Did you know you were cheating by working with a friend/classmate without permission?</h4>

<p>If your instructor says that your work must be your own and you are lost, go to the faculty member or TA only for help.</p>

<h4>Did you know that using the Internet during an exam/homework, even if the faculty member did not specifically say you could not use it, is a cheating violation?</h4>
<p>You might have an online course and the faculty member did not say specifically that you could use the Internet during your exams, but you should ask before doing so. The exceptions to this not being a violation are extremely limited. </p>
<h4>Did you know that submitting work on a blog or in a draft form that is not properly cited, would be seen as plagiarism?</h4>
<p>You are responsible for submitting properly cited work, even in draft forms. You can ask the professor or group if it is OK to submit improperly cited work if you are unsure what needs to be cited and how it should be cited correctly, but it must be agreed upon before you submit. Unless discussed beforehand, your professor does not know your intent, and could mistake your work for plagiarism. </p>
