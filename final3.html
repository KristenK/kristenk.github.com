<p><em>“What is meant by a National School of Mural painting is not a school sponsored by the government but a free vital renascence of American painting. We believe that greater technical freedom of expression and the assignment of mural work by the government to the younger, nationally recognized modern painters might result in such a vital renascence.”</em></p>

<h1>The Project</h1>
<p><em><b>The Writing on the Wall: MoMa, Mexico and American Murals</b></em>,is the MA Thesis of Kristen Korfitzen an Art History graduate Student at George Mason University. <em>The Writing on the Wall</em> takes a closer, case-study driven look at the American mural movement of the early 1930s.  While scholars have begun to re-assess the federally commissioned murals of the great Depression, little work has been done on the years directly preceding the relief programs when the idea of the “American mural” was still being formed. The thesis exams a series of events and works of art that were crucial in shaping what would become the standard iconography of a federal mural, the most central of these events was the 1932 Museum of Modern Art Exhibition <em>Murals by American Painters and Photographers</em>, where the debate over the function and form of American murals came to a head. Equally important are two events concerning the Mexican Artist Diego Rivera, his 1931 MoMA retrospective, and his 1933 commission for Rockefeller center. <em>The Writing on the Wall</em> argues that the dialog surrounding these three events lays out the basic theoretical structure of 1930s American murals, including; appropriate subject matter, location and access to the public, and methods of production.</p>
<h1>The Website</h1>
<p>This website serves as the online companion to <em>The Writing on the Wall</em>. With this site I hope to share my research with the larger academic community, and explore new ways of presenting an Art Historical narrative. This site also allows me to showcase content related to, but not included in, the final thesis. On this site you can find a basic introduction the project, and a condensed discussions of subjects which are further elaborated in my project. <p>
