<h3 id class="caps">The Need for re-examination</h3>
<p>In 1934 American artist George Biddle published an article in Scribner’s Magazine titled “An Art Renascence Under Federal Patronage.” In the piece Biddle calls for the production of a socially conscious form of art to be supported by the government in an effort to facilitate “a revival of art whereby the artist will move from the periphery to the core of national life.”# In particular, Biddle advocates for the government sponsorship of mural commissions to be modeled on the program instituted by Mexican President Alvaro Obregon. The achievements of the Mexican Muralists, primarily Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, not only impressed Biddle, but were admired by a wide variety of artists and critics as a significant step forward in producing relevant and engaging modern art. American theorists, artists and critics had been interested in the mural as a form of art which could transcend the boundaries of “high art” and truly communicate with the public beginning in the late 19th century.(1) The success of the Mexican muralist in creating socially conscious and politically active art instigated a re-examination of the mural in America as a form of art that could be simultaneously traditional, modern, democratic, radical, and above all, of the people.

<blockquote id class="quote">History has brought in a negative verdict on the post-office pictures of the ‘30s... They’re awful murals! Poor art for poor people! When the long-awaited American renaissance finally burst upon the post-war world, it was the firebreathing anarchists who set off the aesthetic bomb. The modernists - the Abstract Expressionists and their numerous progeny - won the battle of styles. From the serene perspective of hindsight, Section art looks pretty dismal, and Section policies seem preposterously wrongheaded.

<p>Mexican Muralism was unquestionably one of the most significant art movements of the early 20th century, and it inspired a generation of artists worldwide to look at public art in a new light. The American mural movement, which today is known mostly for its federal relief murals, is not only overshadowed by the Mexican Muralists but dismissed outright as ugly and uninspired art. The two movements are closely linked, many of the American mural painters travelled to Mexico to work under Rivera, Orozoco, and Siquerious, while "Los Tres Grandes" worked extensivly in the United States as well. Both movements share aeshetic preferences and privaleged a left-wing agenda. Why then, are American murals thought of so negativly?</p>

<p>This project revisits the early American murals of the 1930s, created during a time of renewed optimism in the power of art to affect change. While the work of the Mexican Muralists was helped to jumpstart the American mural renaissance, America already had a long tradition of mural painting and the call for reform in the medium had come long before the Mexican artists. But the absolute mastery of the Mexican muralists set an unattainable standard by which American murals are continued to be judged by today. It is my intention to bring to light how institional biases have colored our view of American murals.</p>
